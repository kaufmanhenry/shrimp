[Demo](https://shrimp-nzhlugodli.now.sh)

### Tech Used 🔧
- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org)
- [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
- [Webpack](http://webpack.js.org)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com)

### Why did I make this? 🤷‍
I wanted to create a super minimal react redux boilerplate without adding all the fluff of many other boilerplates. Many other boilerplates include dozens and dozens of extra, plugins and dependencies. shrimp was designed to keep just the basics, without any other fluff.

In addition, I wanted to create a flexible boilerplate that allowed me to incorporate an express backend without worrying about proxying or creating a separate server.
